# A Note on Git
Git is **THE WORST**. :sob:  
Git is **THE BEST**. :smile:

#### How can both be true?  

##### Your Friend, Git
Let's take the second one first.  Git is the best because it (or version control in general) is immensely useful and solves an important problem.  Accidentally deleted or screwed up a file?  If you have a git repository tracking it you can rollback the change and undo your disaster.  Working on a team simultaneously updating files in a shared project or folder?  Use git to keep track of these and (hopefully) smoothly merge and sync everything.  

##### Git, Your Worst Nightmare
Despite its value, Git can also be infuriating.  The reason is a common fundamental bias.  Git is solving an incredibly challenging problem (syncing and versioning copies of many files as possibly many users make simultaneous updates).  However, Git does it in such a way that it appears like a simple--the simplicity of its commands somewhat masks the challenge of the problem.  

## Don't Stress About Git!   
Now and again, literally **everybody** wants to strangle the creators of Git.  Even the people who are the best at it will look at you in terror if you propose to ask them an open-ended Git question.  For even them, working with Git is very often an exercise in trial and error.  Often no one (even you), knows the full sequence of configuration steps that might've caused whatever issue you may be having, so just take a deep breath and realize that it happens to everyone.  You don't have to memorize every Git command and its signature, just understanding a few basic concepts like fork, branch, clone, pull, add, commit, push, pull request (GitHub), and remote is probably plenty to meet almost all of your Git needs.  When those rare other issues arise, turn to your pal, [Google](http://google.com).  

Bottom line: it's okay!  This isn't going to make or break your career as a Data Scientist!
