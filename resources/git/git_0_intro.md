#Git Intro

##Git Terminology
###Git
Git is a system for version control. It runs at the **command line on your local machine** and allows you to keep track of your files and modifications in a "repository". 

###GitHub
GitHub is a **website** that allows you to upload your git respositories online. It allows you to have a backup of your files, has a visual interface to navigate your repos, and it allows other people (us!) to be able to view your repos. 

GitHub is a central place to store your repo, so others can clone it, push to it, and pull from it.

It also includes some very nice tools for software projects, like Markdown README rendering, issue tracker and wiki tools, and the ability to “fork” a project to make your own independent copy of it for development.

## Why is version control useful?
* **Backup** — coffee + keyboard = #%$*!
	* *Undo* — Oops, was that important?
* **Collaborate** — programming is a team sport
	* *Track steps* — What happened while you were sleeping
	* *Branching and merging* — Work in parallel and bring it back together
	

## Remotes 
Remotes are copies of a repo on another computer **(or on a service like Github)**  

We will use 2 remotes in this course:  
* `upstream` thisismetis/nyc16_ds9
* `origin`   [your forked repo]

## Branches
Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line.
