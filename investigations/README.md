## Investigations

The investigation presentations aim to introduce you to interesting applications and sub-topics of machine learning and data science more broadly. You will research and present briefly on your topic, becoming a relative expert. Your classmates will research and present on their topics so that you may learn from them. This process should expand your appreciation of various ways that data science is applied and help you to think about ways that you can apply what you're learning for your final project.

You can choose from the starter list of topics below, or choose an application that you discover independently, as long as you don't duplicate anyone else's topic. The links included with the starter list represent a starting point - often you'll be able to find much more if you are interested.

Your presentation should be **roughly five minutes long**, light weight in terms of setup and tear-down, and hopefully interesting. You will likely want to include:

 * Who is involved? (A person? A company?)
 * What is the problem that's being addressed?
 * What data is available, being used, or relevant for a technique?
 * What techniques are being developed/applied?
 * How does the application relate to other topics of the class?
 * How does the application relate to the world? What are the implications? (Opportunities? Risks?)

Application Presentations will be delivered **daily at 1:30**, so be sure to be prepared for yours!

How do you know you're done?

 * You have a published blog post about your topic.
 * You have a set of slides (and/or other materials) for your presentation.
 * You have submitted a pull request to this repo/directory with a subdirectory containing your materials and/or links to your materials.
 * You have delivered your presentation to the class.
