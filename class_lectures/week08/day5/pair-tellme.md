#### Pair Problem

**Tell me about your project.**

Tell the whole story of the project:

 * What problem were you solving? Even if the problem didn't come strictly first, introduce it first.
 * What data did you use? How did you get it? Don't forget that the data acquisition process itself can be interesting and impressive! Mention the technologies you used.
 * What techniques did you apply?
 * What results did you achieve? What did you find/learn?

Anticipate questions like:

 * Why did you make those design choices?
 * Did you try X?
 * If you were going to do it again, what would you do differently?
 * If you were going to do more, what else would you try?

If you have extra time, practice your presentation with your partner and time it (goal: 4min). 


_Use positive phrasing._

 * :negative_squared_cross_mark: “It didn’t work. I only got 10% accuracy. Nothing I did improved it. I didn’t have time to try anything else.”
 * :white_check_mark: “The technique I used got 10% accuracy. I tried techniques X, Y, and Z as well, and my original technique was still the best. I’d like to try techniques A, B, and C as well.”
