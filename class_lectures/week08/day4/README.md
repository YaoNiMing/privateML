### Plan for Thur, Nov 10

#### Overview

Today is a new day!  Let's play.

We're gonna dive deep into some learning :smirk:

**Important**: Today is about potential applications of Deep Learning to NLP.  I am not going to claim myself an expert in Deep Learning, but I'm excited to get to play around with these awesome tools a little more with you all.  We'll work from a local notebook for a little while before moving to AWS and really watching those GPUs crank.

**Doubly Important**: Today's topics are supposed to be a fun peek at what's coming around the bend out there.  If you get overwhelmed, don't worry, I probably am too to be honest.  These are peoples' life's work that we're rolling through in a couple hours, so enjoy the time we live in with these awesome tools and **DON'T GET SIDETRACKED FROM YOUR FLETCHER PROJECTS**.  Seriously, from what I've seen you all are going to have some awesome NLP projects without any need for this Deep Learning Stuff.

**Remember:**
* Decision Tree Challenges are due **11/14**
