Write a function or python script for Reverse Polish Notation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation)

For example, String of “3 4 +” it should return 7.    
That’s the base case.  

Certainly can get more complex in “3 4 5 * +” should return 23   
(3 + (4 * 5))

If you are up for additional challenge, write a test for your program.
