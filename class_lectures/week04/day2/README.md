### Plan for Tuesday, Oct 11

#### Overview

So how bout them Giants?

Today you'll see your 2nd classification algorithm!  That would be Logistic Regression.  Ling will take you through that in the morning with a minor discussion of Generalized Linear Models (GLM) as well.

In the afternoon Paul will help you start to get acquainted with Amazon Web Services (AWS) :smile:.  You'll be encouraged to try out AWS for either working on or hosting your McNulty projects (or both!).

**Remember:**
* Linear Splitting challenges are due **10/17**
* Linear Regression Challenges are due **10/17**:
* Challenges 5-6 are due **10/24**
