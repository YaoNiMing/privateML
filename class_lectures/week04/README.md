# Welcome to Week 4: "Classification (with some SQL)"!

### <a name="overview"></a>Overview

You all killed it on Luther.  Seriously, very well done.  I'm especially impressed by your collective calm in the eye of the storm, no one seemed to get too frazzled on what's usually one of the most taxing timeframes in the course.  

Now that you've actually built an end-to-end data science project, it's time to learn some more algorithms.  And boy are we going to eat up algorithms in the next few weeks.

Every weekly page will always include the following:
* [Week Overview](#overview)
* [Miscellaneous Notes for the week](#notes)
* [Metis Events (Speakers, socials, meetups, etc)](#events)
* [Important Due Dates and Deadlines](#dates)
* [Daily Topic Breakdown](#topics)
* [Aggregated Extra Resources List](#resources)

If you're allergic to my verbosity, you're always welcome to simply [skip to the bottom](#topics) for the nuts and bolts!

The third project is [Project McNulty](/projects/02-luther), which will clock in at 2.5 weeks!  Project McNulty is another group project and its main focus will be the following:  
* Classification
* Interacting with Databases via SQL
* Data Visualization via D3

#### Technical Focus
The technical lecture content during Project McNulty will mostly consist of learning various Classification models.  This week we will cover **K-Nearest Neighbors**, **Logistic Regression**, **Naive Bayes**, and **Support Vector Machines** (Oxford commas fo' life).  This week we will have additional forays into **Structured Query Language (SQL)** for talking to databases and a more thorough **Intro to Web Applications** and **Javascript**.  The reason for these additional topics is because for Project McNulty we want you to build a web app, backed by a real live database!  You'll also learn visualization techniques later to put into your web app, but that comes next week.  For now, let's just eat up some models.

* Andrew is going to the Giants' (last?) game tonight, and Paul is maybe going, in case anyone's interested (Note: not a Metis event)
