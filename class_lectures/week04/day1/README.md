### Plan for Monday, Oct 10

#### Overview

Good morning everyone, and welcome to week 4!  It's gonna be yuge, really fantastic, believe me.

Today we move on from regression!  Keep in mind, Linear Regression isn't the only game in town for regression (far from it), as some of you demonstrated with your excellent Project Luther presentations.  There will be a couple techniques that we'll hit as we discuss the topics of the next few weeks that can also be generalized to regression tasks, and we'll highlight those when that's the case.

Which brings me to the topics for Project 3: **Classification**.  Project 3, code-named Duchess...err I mean McNulty...will require you to build a classification model in groups.  We'll discuss more on that later.  This morning you'll get a brief introduction to the task of classification and a simple example in **K-Nearest Neighbors**.

After the Classification intro Ramesh will dazzle us with some Python ninjary for packaging your Python code into reusable components, per your request on Friday.  

After lunch, the topic will be **Structured Query Language**, or **SQL**.  SQL is the de facto standard for talking to databases, most commonly **relational databases**.  However, SQL is so popular that these days a SQL interface is built on top of almost every new tool because analysts are so used to working with it.  

**An Important Note on SQL**:  
Why do you need to know SQL?  Thanks for asking!  In Project McNulty we're going to request that you store your data in a SQL database and interact with it from there (with some possible exceptions).  I will caution, SQL can feel a little bit awkward at first if you haven't worked with it before, but I promise you it's actually not hard!  Don't feel discouraged if it all seems like a confusing mess to you at first because that's very common.  One day (soon) it will just click and you'll wonder why you ever had such struggles in the first place.  The only way to get to that point, however, is practice.  Thus, we'll have a number of SQL exercises for you to try out on your own.

After the SQL Intro we'll introduce Project McNulty and break out for work time.  You have **5 challenges(!)** on your plate right now (and some SQL exercises!), so this is a good time to catch up on those.  However, it's recommended that you at least spend **a little time** brainstorming in your group for McNulty.

**Remember:**
* Pandas challenges are due **Today**
* Linear Splitting challenges are due **10/17**
* Challenges 4-6 are due **10/24**
