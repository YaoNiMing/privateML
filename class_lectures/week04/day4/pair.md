### Pair Problem

This function is boring:

```python
def square(x):
    return x * x

square(5)
## 25
```

Write a _decorator_ called `talky` so that when you run this:

```python
@talky
def square(x):
    return x * x

answer = square(5)
```

You get the following output:

```
Oh hi! - The result is -
25
```

---

Extension: Write a decorator `talky_with`, so that when you run this:

```python
@talky_with("mathbot")
def square(x):
    return x * x

answer = square(5)
```

You get the following output:

```
Oh hi! I'm mathbot.
The result sure is -
25
```
