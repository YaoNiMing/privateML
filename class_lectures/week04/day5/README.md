### Plan for Friday, Oct 14

#### Overview
<img src='rain.jpg'/>  

Today you get another classifier!  This time, it's **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**.  Ling has done this lecture a number of times and has extra background here, so it should be a good one!

In the afternoon it's back to work.  Remember on McNulty you should really be having something classified at this point, at least a first pass.  You should also probably be thinking about what type of web page you might want to build to demonstrate your results (if you haven't already).  Make sure you **break out tasks** for each group member to work on, one of which could be to create the skeleton for that Flask app.

**Remember:**
* Luther Blogs are due **Today**
* 2-on-1s with Jason and Debbie (Day 2) are in the afternoon today
* Linear Splitting challenges are due **10/17**
* Linear Regression Challenges are due **10/17**:
* Challenges 5-6 are due **10/24**
* Fridays are for happiness
