## Pair Problem

1. Build a Machine Learning Model for Auto Miles Per Gallon dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG)

2. Predict MPG based on other numerical features

3. Pickle your Model

4. Wrap your Model as an API Service similar to the `predictor_app` we looked at yesterday

5. Query your predictor_app from Jupyter Notebook and `requests` module.

You don't need to write any HTML, but will need to copy predictor_app when creating this one.

Note: Please build this outside of SF16_DS4 or in your local folder to avoid checking in to git accidentally.
