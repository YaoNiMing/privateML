### Plan for Wednesday, Oct 12

#### Overview

Today we'll (re)discover the joy and usefulness of **Bayes' Theorem**.  Particularly, we'll focus on its usefulness in the context of **Bayesian Inference** and specifically classification via a simplifying assumption that yields the **Naive Bayes** Classifier.  Today all of the work that we did building up your probability base should really pay dividends.

**Remember:**
* Linear Splitting challenges are due **10/17**
* Linear Regression Challenges are due **10/17**:
* Challenges 5-6 are due **10/24**
