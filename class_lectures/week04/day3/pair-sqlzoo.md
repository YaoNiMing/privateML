### Pair Problem

For today's pair problem, let's practice more SQL!

[SQLZOO](http://sqlzoo.net/) is a step-by-step SQL learning platform with an interactive interpreter originally developed by the School of Computing of Napier University, Edinburgh, UK. They have many resources on SQL tutorials as well as quizzes. 

Choose one of the following topics and finish the whole module. If you have time, do both of them! If you are done with both, go ahead and take the quizzes or explore other topics on the cite.

 * [(Nested) SELECT](http://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_within_SELECT_Tutorial)
 * [JOINS](http://sqlzoo.net/wiki/More_JOIN_operations)


If you are well-versed with SQL, feel free to jump ahead to the bottom of the page and start with the Harder Questions section.
