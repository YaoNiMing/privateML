#### Pair Problem

Today we are going to do a couple of interview style brain-teaser problems.

1. *Cocktail Party Problem:* You go to a cocktail party with your significant other.  There are 10 couples at the party (including you and your partner).  At the end of the party you ask every person (not including yourself) how many different people they shook hands with over the course of the night.  To your surprise, each person reports a different number.  No one shook hands with themselves or with their partner.  How many people did your significant other shake hands with that night?
(Extra credit: solve the problem in general for *n* couples)

2. *Drunk Airline Passenger:* A 100 seat flight has checked in full.  The first passenger to board is drunk, and so rather than choosing his own seat he sits in a random seat.  Subsequently, each passenger boarding the plane takes their assigned seat if it is vacant, or otherwise chooses a random seat.  You are the last of the 100 passengers to board.  What is the probability that you sit in your assigned seat?
