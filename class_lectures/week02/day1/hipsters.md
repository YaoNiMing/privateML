## The Hipster Game

Hipsters. How to rid the earth of them? That is a question for the military. Also: should we? Maybe not. That's for the American people to decide. If someday this comes to a referendum, the military will need a reliable classifier to determine who is a hipster,  and who shall be spared. The contract to build that classifier will go to a data scientist.

It's never too early to be prepared.

Truth be told, this is really just an icebreaker game designed to help us continue to get to know each other. Some of our personal friends are hipsters, and we wish them no harm. At least, we wish them no grave or irreversible harm.

So, we're going to create  some classifiers that the NSA can't get their hands on. Also, they probably won't want them. You'll see.

### The mission

Your team of probably three people will be given a dossier of photos. Using our internal classifiers (our brains, trained by our experience on earth observing and interacting with other humans), we will label the photos in the dossier (the "training set").

As a team, your job is to create a classifier that separates the training set of pictures into 'hipsters' and 'non-hipsters', according to their labels. You can do this pretty much however you want, but please see the rules below.

### Here are some rules:

 1. This is for fun, so don't be a Melvin or a no-fun-nik.
 2. **No computers**. Write your classifier on paper or slips of paper.
 3. Any rules or judgments used in your classifiers should be vaguely objective*.
 The standard for "vaguely objective" is this: you will build your classifier on the training set, and then you will give it to Irmak and Bo, who will use it to classify the photos in the test set. If you use slang we don't know, we'll throw an error. If you use something really subjective, like "punchable face" or "stands like a jerk", we will use our own subjectivity, not yours, to apply your rule. Challenge this guideline at your own risk, but appeals will not be granted under this rule.
 5. Appeals of any kind will not be granted.
 6. It should not take a crazy amount of time to classify each picture.
 7. This is for fun, so don't be a hot head, a Melvin, a "Well Actually", a no-fun-nick, or a grade grubber.
 8. All deviances from good practices in machine learning are intentional or unimportant (see rules #1 and #6).

### Test phase
When the classifiers are finished or when time is up, we'll use your classifier on the test set of photos. These will be pre-labeled by a process we call Never You Mind. [Yes, this is weird. See rules #1 and #6 if necessary.]

The winner will be the group that has the most fun! Just kidding. We'll see who matches the most test set hipsters. If time allows, teams will have the chance to go back and revise their classifiers for a second test set.

## Good luck to us all.
