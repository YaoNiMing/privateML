### Plan for Monday, Sep 26

#### Overview

Good morning friends.  Welcome back.  Hopefully you all relaxed after week 1 and are ready to really kick things into gear, but if you spent all weekend on Benson challenges that's fine too :wink:.

Today we'll introduce Machine Learning.  We'll do it in two ways, first with some [slides](Intro_to_Machine_Learning.pdf) and then with a game, the infamous [Hipster Game](hipsters.md).  Let's have some fun with that, details to come.

In the afternoon we'll introduce **Web Scraping** with **BeautifulSoup** and **Selenium** so you can steal all of your favorite company's data...err uh, I mean so you can learn to pull data from pretty much any location on the world's greatest data source, the interwebs.  The motivation for this will be clear when we introduce Luther at the end of the day, which will require these skills.

**Remember:**
* Today is the first day of [Investigations](/investigations)!  These will be daily at 1:30 pm, run by Ramesh, so **please be back from lunch on time** to respect your fellow classmates.
* Your **Benson/week 1 blogs** are **due tomorrow**

#### Schedule
