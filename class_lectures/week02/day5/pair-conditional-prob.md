## Pair Problem (some more Probability...)

### Truck Arrival Times

There are 2 trucks making deliveries, with the following facts:
- Truck A will arrive at random at any time in the continuous time range between 8 and 10 am (aka 8:27, 9:02 and 34 seconds, etc)
- Truck B is the exact same except shifted an hour later, so it arrives at random between 9 and 11 am.

Your task for the first problem is to tell me the probability that truck B arrives before truck A.

Please come up with solutions in at least 2 of the following 3 ways:
1. Analytically: Write down equations for Conditional Probability
2. Graphically: Draw a plot that helps explain the answer
3. Computationally: Run a Monte Carlo simulation that estimates the numerical solution

### Random Integers

You are playing an interesting form of the lottery, with the following setup:  
- There are 2 batches of ping pong balls of 100 balls each.  
- The balls in each batch are numbered with the integers from 1 to 100.
- You will draw 1 ball from each batch.
- You **win** if either ball you draw is twice the value of the other ball.
- What is your probability of winning this game?

Again, please come up with solutions in at least 2 of the 3 ways:
1. Analytically
2. Graphically
3. Computationally via Simulation

Hint: For both problems it might be easiest to code up a simple simulation first to get yourself an answer, then think about how you get there analytically or graphically.  But to each his/her own :wink:
