### Plan for Thursday, Sep 29

#### Overview

Today we'll introduce **Probability**.  A good understanding of Probability and Statistics is vital for things we'll do going forward.  In the afternoon we'll finish the bikes and then you'll have the whole time to work on Luther.  Short and sweet today.

**Remember:**
* You need to have your Luther scraping **complete** by **Friday**
* Benson challenges are due **Monday**
* Pandas challenges are due **10/10**
