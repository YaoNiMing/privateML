### Plan for Wednesday, Sep 28

#### Overview

Yesterday we learned a lot, and today we'll pick up right where we left off.  You learned about Linear Regression (our first Supervised Machine Learning model), and Regularization for avoiding overfitting in Linear Regression.  Paul touched on splitting into train/test splits with `sklearn` and implied that there was more to this theory.  

Well today you'll see just that, as you learn about **Cross-Validation**.  **This may be the most important lecture of the entire course**.  Every model you try needs to be cross-validated, otherwise you can have no confidence that your model is going to generalize well to future data.  Make sure you understand today's concepts completely, as you'll apply them every step of the way from here on out.

In the afternoon you'll have, finally, the entire session to work on the various items that are currently on your plate.  You have most of the skills that you really need to rock Project Luther, so get after it.  Also, if you have more on the Bikes exercise feel free to reunite with your partner and work on that.

**Remember:**
* You need to submit an informal Luther proposal to Paul and Ling by end of of day **today**
* You need to have your Luther scraping **complete** by **Friday**
* Benson challenges are due **Monday**
* Pandas challenges are due **10/10**
* Ling and Ramesh will be out this afternoon, but Paul and Nathan will be available for help
