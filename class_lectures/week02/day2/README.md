### Plan for Tuesday, Sep 27

#### Overview

Get ready to **KICK IT UP** a notch today.  You'll be doing a ton of exercises.  Make good friends with your pair partner this morning, as you'll be spending ample time together.  Be ready to focus and work hard, and you'll learn an amazing amount of fun things today that you'll be able to apply to **Project Luther**.

The Pair programming problem will be a primer for Linear Regression, the main topic of today.  Work quickly, as we have no time to waste to get to the meat of the lecture material.

The lecture will be on **Linear Regression**, **Overfitting**, and **Regularization**.  These topics will be invaluable in coming up with awesome ideas to rock Project Luther (Stringer).  After the lecture, we'll have a marathon Jupyter Notebook for you to work through in pairs that will reinforce the concepts from lecture (with a minor detour into **Pickling** objects in Python so that you can save them to disk for later).  

**NOTE:** This assignment is for you, it's just an exercise, so you don't have to submit it.  However, it will be tremendously useful for the remainder of the course (I hope!) so be sure to bookmark it in your minds.  We'll do the first part together to introduce **`sklearn`** and **`statsmodels`**--the 2 packages we'll use most for **Machine Learning** in here--and then you'll be let loose on the rest of the thing.

In the afternoon we'll have an investigation and then you'll be free to continue working on the exercise or to move on to Project Luther or the 2 outstanding challenges.

**Remember:**
* Your **Benson/week 1 blogs** are **due today**
* You need to have your Luther scraping **complete** by **Friday**
* I'm adding a deadline, Luther ideas informally to Ling and Paul via Slack by **Wednesday**

* Benson Challenges
* Pandas Challenges

**4:00-5:00 pm**: Paul and Ling give feedback individually (in groups) on Benson

**6:00 pm:** Hoo boy, how do you feel?  Probably about how I felt after that debate last night.  Go home and recharge :smile:
