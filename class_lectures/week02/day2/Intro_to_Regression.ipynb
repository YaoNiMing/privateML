    "# Intro to Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to go through a few regression exercises that will help you better see how regression might work in action in Python.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "The packages and techniques we'll hope to get comfortable with in this activity are the following:\n",
    "- [***statsmodels***](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/): a package mainly best at doing regressions with traditional R formula syntax\n",
    "- [***R formulas***](http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/datamgmt/statistics/r/formulas/): R formulas are a convenient way for encapsulating functional relationships for regressions\n",
    "- [***seaborn***](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/): We'll use seaborn for **visualization** as we go along\n",
    "- [***scikit-learn***](http://scikit-learn.org/dev/index.html): This is the main machine learning package we'll be using throughout the course.  It has a multitude of machine learning algorithms and helpful machine learning pipeline tools.  sklearn has a tremendous amount of functionality, to get the most out of this course it will help to really explore the depth of the documentation on your own and watch as you understand more and more of the functionality as the course progresses.\n",
    "- [***Linear Regression***](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html) with scikit-learn:  We'll work with the basic linear regression module(s)\n",
    "- [***Variable Preprocessing and Polynomial Regression***](http://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/preprocessing.html#preprocessing) with scikit-learn:  We'll be **\"standardizing\"** or **\"normalizing\"** many of our variables to yield better model data.  We'll show how the \"linear\" models can be extended to basically any type of function by using functions of the different fields as the inputs to the linear model.\n",
    "- [***Regularization and Cross-Validation***](http://scikit-learn.org/dev/model_selection.html#model-selection): This is how you know if your model will **generalize** to real-world data and how you evaluate the success of your model.  We will see more on **cross-validation** to come so we'll take it as given today.  Today, the focus is on **regularization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Datasets\n",
    "We'll take a look at a few different datasets:\n",
    "1. [Survey Responses](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/examples/chp/p054.txt) (done together)\n",
    "2. Manufactured random dataset  (done together)\n",
    "3. [Bike sharing dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset) (exercise, in pairs)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "Try running the following imports and check that they all import successfully.  If they do not, the commands for the installs are given below.  If necessary, at a command line window use `pip` to install the ones that are failing for you and then retry the imports."

When 2 predictor variables are highly correlated this is called [multicollinearity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity) and it is something we want to watch out for as it can destabilize our model.  In the extreme case, when 2 predictors are perfectly correlated then there is absolutely nothing gained by making both variables part of our regression.\n",

It has a bunch of nice features for evaluating and executing such models.  Essentially, a linear model is one that is a **linear function of the parameters**.  For Linear Regression, this means the parameter $\\beta$ (note that here $\\beta$ is a **vector** of parameters, which includes $\\beta_0$, $\\beta_1$, $\\beta_2$, etc).  We'll discuss linear models generally later but for  now just accept that Linear Regression is one of these.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modeling with Statsmodels\n",
    "There are 2 main ways you can generate models with stats models:\n",
    "- Via the `statsmodels.api` package\n",
    "- Via the `statsmodels.formula.api` package\n",
    "\n",
    "For both approaches, you'll need somewhere to use the [R formula](http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/datamgmt/statistics/r/formulas/) styles formulas for defining the relationship between target variable and feature variables in your model.  ***Statsmodels*** uses [***patsy***](http://patsy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) to convert this syntax into the proper data matrices for input into its linear models under the covers.  There are a variety of interactions and functions of variables that you can incorporate with this syntax, so feel free to check out the docs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll just start by defining a regression model that takes as its inputs each of the 6 predictor variables.  The other parameter of course is the data that the model is to be built from, our pandas dataframe.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `statsmodels.api`\n",

We will use that here.\n",

In other words, if we had a coefficient whose true value should be 0 (aka the predictor has no impact on the response) then this P-value is the probability of finding such a coefficient value in our regression by random chance.  In essence, it measures our degree of belief that the coefficient for each variable should be zero.  Thus, the lowest P-values represent the most likely predictors to be impacting the response.\n",

    "### Polynomial Regression\n",
    "So far we've only tried to create regression models that are linear functions of the predictor variables.  However, there's no reason we can't transform the predictor variables by any type of function we want before inputting them to linear regression.  This is the idea behind [**Polynomial Regression**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_regression) and it allows us (along with similar functional regressions) to essentially model our response variables as any function of our predictor variables that we like.  Viewed in this way, Linear Regression is just a special instance of Polynomial Regression with a polynomial of degree 1.\n",

    "#### Polynomial Regression with sklearn\n",
    "sklearn has built-in options for converting your predictor variables to polynomial functions of them.  In this exercise we'll use the [**PolynomialFeatures**](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures.html) class of sklearn to manipulate incoming predictors into nth-order polynomials of those features.  We'll combine this with the [***make_pipeline***](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.make_pipeline.html) function to string together a pipeline of operations that is able to first transform our linear features into polynomial features and then run a linear regression against the resulting polynomial features. \n",

Any field with n unique categorical values can be reformulated into n indicator variable fields where each represents whether or not that attribute value is present.\n",
