# Welcome to Week 2: "Intro to Machine Learning and Regression"!

### <a name="overview"></a>Overview

Welcome back friends!  Hopefully week 1 and Benson have made you even more ready to continue your journey into Data Science.  Your Benson presentations were fantastic, so I'm looking forward to seeing what you all can come up with on even more advanced data science projects.

Every weekly page will always include the following:
* [Week Overview](#overview)
* [Miscellaneous Notes for the week](#notes)
* [Metis Events (Speakers, socials, meetups, etc)](#events)
* [Important Due Dates and Deadlines](#dates)
* [Daily Topic Breakdown](#topics)
* [Aggregated Extra Resources List](#resources)

If you're allergic to my verbosity, you're always welcome to simply [skip to the bottom](#topics) for the nuts and bolts!

The second project is [Project Luther](/projects/02-luther), which will be double the length of Benson at 2 weeks.  Project Luther is an individual project and its main focus will be the following:  
* Machine Learning Concepts
* Regression
* Web Scraping: Getting data from the Web
* Selecting and Evaluating a Machine Learning Model
* Feature Selection

#### Technical Focus
The technical lecture content during Project Luther will focus on introductory Machine Learning methods and concepts, specifically in **Supervised Learning**.  In the first week, you'll understand what machine learning is and how it works.  You'll learn techniques for **regression**, predictive modeling techniques that try to estimate a numerical output from a set of attributes about a data observation.  To get your data for Luther you won't just be given a clean data file this time; you'll be extracting it from **HTML** on web pages so you'll need to learn techniques for **Web Scraping** in Python with **`BeautifulSoup`** and **`Selenium`**.  You'll also be introduced to various techniques for evaluating and improving your models through **Model Evaluation** and **Feature Selection**.  At the end of the week, we'll provide an intro to **Probability** that will set you up for further Machine Learning techniques going forward.
