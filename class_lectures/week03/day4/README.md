### Plan for Thursday, Oct 6

#### Overview

Today we'll finish our probability and stats primers, good riddance.  Well not really actually.  Of course these concepts will be intertwined with many things we do for the rest of the course.  I believe that as a group you all are quite strong in this area, which is great!  That's really the harder stuff to teach if students don't have a solid base in it, and from what I can tell you'll have no problem there so we can just have fun playing with Python and lovingly massaging data.

**A Loving Letter to my Statistician Friends**:  
I have posted my thoughts on some of the things I was poorly trying to convey yesterday [here](Pauls_Thoughts_on_Stats_and_Life.md).  Aha!  Gotcha!  I haven't finished it yet, but I wanted to put it there as a placeholder to make sure you take a look at it when you get a chance.

As for today, Ling will tackle some of those damned assumptions for Linear Regression.  You should notice pretty quickly that they're probably pretty shaky for this project, and why it makes Linear Regression often a very (often too much so) restrictive model.  

Then I'll close out the morning and the week's content with some discussion of actual statistics, aka hypothesis/significance/AB testing and everyone's favorite Medial Boundary Theorem (that's what it's called, right??).

Afternoon we'll discuss presentations for a moment after investigations, then **you will finish them**, or I'll find you.

**Remember:**
* Pandas challenges are due **10/10**
* Linear Splitting challenges are due **10/17**
