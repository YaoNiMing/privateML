#### Pair Problem

Every Group is assigned a Roman Numeral, I, II, III or IV.


Copy the data locally from [this Google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V26-vVOtnFBlbY7fI3O1jwN3h0mgmfJvzBSklxsQvO0/edit#gid=280338943) *for your group only* and do the following calculations.

For the items 1-2 below, please use a graph paper and Calculator (Phone).  Don't do the calculations on the computer.

 1. Calculate the average value and variance by hand. 
 2. Calculate the [Pearson's coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient) of x and y. 
 
 3. Now calculate the slope and y-intercept of the best-fit line to the data (`SLOPE` and `INTERCEPT` in both). 

 4. Plot the data by hand using the graph paper. If possible, use one color for your data, another for your best-fit line and another for everything else.
 5. When we're all done, Take a snapshot and put in Slack. How do they look?
 6. Let's talk about our charts and go over some basic ideas and charting terms.
