# Welcome to Week 5: "Data Visualization ft. D3! (and some more Classifiers)"!

### <a name="overview"></a>Overview

Can you believe that we're already 1/3 of the way done??  I certainly can't, I guess time does fly when you're havin' fun.

At this point you've learned a couple of classifiers.  This week we'll learn a few more.

But the **main focus** will be on **Data Visualization with D3**!  You'll have 2+ days (Tues-Thurs) where Ramesh tries to whip you into shape with D3 and Javascript so you can beat some sweet web-based visualizations for your McNulty Projects.

Every weekly page will always include the following:
* [Week Overview](#overview)
* [Miscellaneous Notes for the week](#notes)
* [Metis Events (Speakers, socials, meetups, etc)](#events)
* [Important Due Dates and Deadlines](#dates)
* [Daily Topic Breakdown](#topics)
* [Aggregated Extra Resources List](#resources)

If you're allergic to my verbosity, you're always welcome to simply [skip to the bottom](#topics) for the nuts and bolts!

The third project is [Project McNulty](/projects/02-luther), which will clock in at 2.5 weeks!  Project McNulty is another group project and its main focus will be the following:  
* Classification
* Interacting with Databases via SQL
* Data Visualization via D3

#### Technical Focus
The technical lecture content during Project McNulty will mostly consist of learning various Classification models.  This week we will cover **Decision Trees**, **Ensemble Methods**, **Random Forests**, **Boosted Trees** (e.g. **XGBoost**), and last but obviously not least, **Neural Networks** (Oxford commas fo' life).  On Monday we'll talk about methods for **evaluating your classification models**, as choosing what is exactly the best model for a given circumstance can actually be trickier than it might seem at first.  I also hope you really take **Ensemble Methods** to heart, as they're what a lot of the really good systems (Read: Netflix) are doing under the covers.
