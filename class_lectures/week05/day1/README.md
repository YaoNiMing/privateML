### Plan for Monday, Oct 17

#### Overview
Hello, my friends, hello!

Happy Week 5 aka Ramesh week.  Well actually unfortunately today you're stuck with just me.

Today I'm going to take you through the absurd amount of options you have for evaluating your classification models.  This is important to understand well because the context of a given classification project (say, perhaps, the one you're working on now...go figure!) can dictate what sorts of errors are more or less acceptable in your models.

If we have a little more time I might continue on to introduce Ensemble Models, the idea of grouping together multiple models in a smart way to create one aggregate model that's better than all the individual ones.  Likely this will mainly be Thursday's topic, but we'll see how things go!

**Remember:**
* Linear Splitting challenges are due **Today**
* Linear Regression Challenges are due **Today**
* Classification Challenges are due **10/24**
* Classification Errors Challenges are due **10/24**

#### Schedule

**9:00 am**: It's good to need you so

**9:15 am**: Pair Programming:
  * Pair: [More Flask!](pair-classmet.md)

Pairings:  

| Partner 1 | Partner 2 |

**10:30 am**: Is our model any darn good?
* [Classification Evaluation](Classification_Evaluation.ipynb)

**12:00 pm**: It's good to love you, like I do

**1:30 pm**: Investigation Presentation: Ron Olshansky-Lucero on "Cannalytics: ML for LM"

**1:45 pm** Working Times
* Please focus on challenges today unless you have a project fire drill
  * If you've built **any** remotely successful classifier at this point, you don't have a fire drill
  * Ideally we'd be starting D3 today, but Ramesh is at a conference :cry:
  * D3 will take up all of your powers of concentration this week, so get those challenges out of the way now!
* [Challenge 3: Train/Test Splits](/challenges/03-linear_splitting)
* [Challenge 4: Linear Regression and Learning Curves](/challenges/04-linear_learning)
* [McNulty](/projects/03-mcnulty)
* [Challenge 5: Classification](/challenges/05-classification)
* [Challenge 6: Classification Metrics](/challenges/06-classification_metrics)

**6:00 pm:** And to feel this way, when I hear you say, hello
