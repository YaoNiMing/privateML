### Plan for Wed, Nov 16

#### Overview

Thank you everyone for heeding what I said yesterday and delivering perfect attendance for the speaker.  

As we wind down the final stages of this class (:sob:), we need to accelerate your project timelines.  For this reason, we will have a project work day all day today, and I mean a serious work day.  This project will not be like the others--there will be no night-before fire drills or all-nighters, you need to think of the due date as being a week earlier than Career Day (so Dec 6 or so).  The last week will be spent practicing and perfecting your presentations and (potentially) implementing any **reach** goals.  

You will all feel much better if you work early on like this is a short-term project and then are just fine tuning in the last couple weeks.

Given this, here are the deadlines we're setting for the project:

| Checkpoint | Date |
|------------|------|
| Idea Finalized | Wed, Nov 16 |
| Data Acquired | Fri, Nov 18 |
| MVP (Minimal Model Built) | Wed, Nov 23 |
| Dry Run 1 | Wed, Dec 7 |
| Dry Run 2 | Fri, Dec 9 |
| Career Day Dry Run 1 | Mon, Dec 12 |
| Final Career Day Dry Run | Tue, Dec 13 |
