#### Pair Problem

Today we will take pair programming to brainstorm ideas about Project Kojak together. This is free-style and don't worry if it goes overtime. The entire morning is pair and brainstorm time.

Project Kojak is the passion project that you will present to potential employers on career day. You have all the choices on project scope, data sources, modelings, tools, and communication styles. You can either start a new project, or pick up where you left from Fletcher. 


Get into a team of 3-5 people. Each person takes turns to talk about his/her project Kojak idea.
 
* What is the project motivation? 

* Who will use your end product and how? 

* What kind of data will you need? Will you be able to get it? 

* What is the modeling process? How would you evaluate performance?


The rest of the group brainstorms with the person together and is reponsible to come up with **3 possible data sources** for the person. If it is an API, make sure it provides the specific fields that the project will need. If it is a published dataset, make sure you have access to download it. If it is scraping, sit together to inspect the elements of the page(s) and devise a roadmap to scrape.

Do this for everyone in your group.
