### Plan for Friday, Nov 4

#### Overview

Today you get a break from Paul.  Ling will teach you about Recommender Systems, which could be a useful application for either of your final 2 projects.  These permeate your lives these days, so I think everyone should have a pretty solid intuition for them.

* SQL Challenges are due **11/4**
* Decision Tree Challenges are due **11/14**
