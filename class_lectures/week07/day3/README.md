### Plan for Wednesday, Nov 2

#### Overview

Hoo boy, have we got a loaded day today.  I'm excited, are you?

Basically, we're gonna hit a bunch of **Vector Space Models (VSMs)** for NLP.  They start and finish in similar places but take different routes along the way, so buckle up.  Specifically, we're going to try to cover all of **TFIDF**, **Latent Semantic Indexing/Analysis (LSI/LSA, same thing)**, **Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**, and glorious **word2vec** in just 1 day.  This should be a fun few hours.

As we go through, keep in mind that the end goal of all of these is the same, **to yield word vectors!**


**Remember:**
* SQL Challenges are due **11/4**
* Decision Tree Challenges are due **11/14**
