### Pair Problem

You are given the following three documents:

```python
text = ["wookie stormtrooper",
        "wookie wookie wookie stormtrooper stormtrooper stormtrooper",
        "harry potter"]
```
        
 * Transform this data into a bag of words representation, with simple counts. How informative is this format? How much information do you have about individual words?
 * Calculate Euclidean and cosine distances between each pair of documents. How do these distances relate to your intuition for the documents' similarities?
 * Calculate one minus the cosine distance between each pair of de-meaned documents, and the Pearson correlation coefficient between each pair of documents. How are they related? Is this a coincidence? Find a counterexample or prove that there isn't one.
