### Plan for Monday, Oct 31

#### Overview

Trick-or-Treat... :smirk:

And **Happy NLP Week**!

Can't wait for this week and next.  Today will be relatively simpler compared to what's to come.  I'll mostly just introduce **NLP** with a broad overview of applications and common tasks and the toolkits available to complete them.  As the week goes on however, we'll get into some pretty awesome stuff.


**Remember:**
* SQL Challenges are due **11/4**
* More things are due later, will update
