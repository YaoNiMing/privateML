### Plan for Friday, Sep 23

#### Overview

Today is all Benson!  Aside from the Pair problem in the morning, you'll have all morning to finish up your projects.  After lunch, you will present them.

**Remember:**
* Presentations will begin at 1:30 pm
* You should be working on creating/practicing your presentations (and your proposals) this morning.  Data work should be done.
* Proposal write-ups are due on the repo (via pull request) at the end of the day today
* Just put all of your project materials in your pull request, as it could be useful for others to see what you've done.
* Write a blog!  You'll be required to blog about your Benson project.  We'll discuss this afternoon.
