# Fork, Clone, Blog, Markdown

**Have your blog full personalized: remove or replace all the defaults and filler. You should also set up Google Analytics for your blog. Make sure all your information is complete in the class info and signup document.**

### Objectives:

 * Fork and clone repositories on GitHub.
 * Publish blog posts using Markdown.


### Ideas:

 * Git is distributed; every local repository is self-sufficient.
 * GitHub hosts repositories and makes them accessible in a variety of ways, including:
     * forking (copying a GitHub hosted repo to be another GitHub hosted repo)
     * cloning (copying a GitHub hosted repo to be a repo on your computer)
     * serving the repo's contents as a web site (including pre-processing with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/))
 * Markdown is a simple text format for writing web documents.


### Process:

 * Fork the [barryclark/jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) repo to your GitHub account.
 * Rename your fork to be called `yourgithubusername.github.io`. This is a GitHub convention for making a "user page".
 * Notice you now have a web site at `yourgithubusername.github.io`.
 * Clone your fork to your local machine with `git clone`.
 * Edit the files locally (both configuration and markdown files), commit, and push back up to your fork on GitHub.
 * Break the "fork" relationship on GitHub by deleting the repo on GitHub, creating a new blank repo, and pushing back from your local machine.

### Other options and improvements

 * There are a lot of other [Jekyll themes](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Themes) that you could use. (That's not the only list of themes either.)
 * Another blogging option is [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/), which is written in Python and can be made to integrate nicely with Python Jupyter notebooks.
