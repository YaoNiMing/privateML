### Plan for Thursday, Sep 22

#### Overview

Good early morning!  Today we finish Benson.  That is, you should really aim to finish the data crunching aspects of your project today.  If you haven't already laid out and delegated tasks for your group, you need to do that ASAP.  You'll have the entire afternoon to work on this today, and on Friday morning you really should just be preparing your presentations and proposals.

In preparation for your Benson presentations, Ling will give a presentation on presentations--so meta--so pay attention and apply some of these concepts for your presentations tomorrow.  As far as technical content, this morning we'll get a second dose of `pandas` and briefly review possible answers to the first 3 Data Munging Challenges.  

**Remember:**
* Summer cohort Career Day is at 5 pm today!  We'll finish up at 5.  You are all welcome to attend and watch the presentations, however please **do not** take any networking time from the summer students.  Leave them alone to chat with the employers and leave the employers alone as well--for this your time will come :wink:.
