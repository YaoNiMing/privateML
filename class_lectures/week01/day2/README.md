### Plan for Tuesday, Sep 20

#### Overview

Day 2 is primarily for really diving into [Project Benson](/projects/01-benson) and its associated challenges.  After Pair Programming in the morning Ling will lecture on several different aspects of Python that will come in handy as you go through the course.  This includes best practices, some gotchas, and the coolness that is Jupyter/IPython.

As emphasized on Day 1, soft skills are important for Benson.  Thus, Paul will walk you through some guidelines for brainstorming that apply to all of your projects, as well as how you should use an iterative approach to tackle all of your data science projects.

The rest of the day will be yours, to use your time (on either projects or challenges) as you see fit!

**Remember:**
* Project Benson Backstories are due end of day today
* We will review challenge problems 1-3 tomorrow, Wednesday 9/21
* The full challenge set is not due until Monday 10/3
