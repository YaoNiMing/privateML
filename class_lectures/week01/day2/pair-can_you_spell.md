#### Can you spell

Sal's classroom has a bag of alphabet magnets. She wants to know if she can spell her friend's name using the letters in the bag. Write a function that will take a list of alphabets and a name and print out yes if the name can be spelled and no otherwise.

    CanYouSpell(['y','n','p','g','n','l'],"lynn") would print YES
    CanYouSpell(['y','n','p','g','l'],"lynn") would print NO

When you are done, submit to the Slack channel.
