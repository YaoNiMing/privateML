### Plan for Wednesday, Sep 21

<img src="img/hump_day.jpg"/>

#### Overview

For Day 3 of Benson the main focus will be actually looking at your data, aka some data visualization.  At this point your basic data exploration with the MTA data should've given you some feel for it, now you'll want to ratchet that up by making some plots etc with **matplotlib** and the lovely **seaborn**.  

In addition, we'll do a brief crash course in the Unix command line for some basics and more that will be useful throughout your data science careers, plus a few more notes on packaging, distributing, and running Python programs.

In the afternoon you'll have more time to work on Benson things.  You should make finishing challenges 1-3 your first priority (feel free to collaborate) as I'll go over them at the end of the day today.

**Remember:**
* Informal Benson check-ins with Paul/Ling today, you must have your ideas formally defined and approved today, 2 days till presentations!
