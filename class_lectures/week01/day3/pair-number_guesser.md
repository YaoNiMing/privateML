#### Number Guesser

For your Metis application you wrote a program that let's the user guess a number between 1 and 100. Can you do the opposite. Now the user would pick a number and the computer will make the guesses until it gets the right answer.

		def guess(13) would return "I got it right in 8 tries."

**What's the complexity of your code? Can you do better?**
