### Plan for Monday, Sep 19

#### Overview

Welcome to Day 1!  This morning we'll take care of some general ***administrative things*** like ***introductions***, getting to know the space, and making sure everyone has ***Slack*** and ***Git/GitHub*** working.  Slack is a messaging app which we'll use for just about all class communications, so it's important to get to know it!  You can do all sorts of fun things in Slack, for some examples take a look at [Fun with Slack](/resources/fun_with_slack.md).

Once the red tape is out of the way, we'll dive right into some data science.  For the first lecture Paul will provide a high level ***overview of the bootcamp and data science*** in general.  

Then you'll start getting your hands dirty right away with a ***Pair Programming problem***.  Pair problems are something we'll do at the start of every day to help wake your brains and introduce you to various fun challenges in Python or general algorithms that either deepen your understanding of content or prepare you for possible job interview questions.

After the pair problem, you'll get your first ***introduction to Git and GitHub*** and the strategies we will use in the course for distributing content and for you to submit your work back to us.  ***Pay attention and mark this for reference***, as Git will stay lurking in the background throughout the course.  However, ***don't fret too much about memorizing every aspect of Git*** or if you're having a little bit of trouble with it at first--everyone does--you'll get better with practice and you'll always have today's exercise for reference (see the [Note on Git](/references/git/note_on_git.md) for more on this).  There are many things you can do with Git, but ***we suggest you mainly stick to the Git functionality explicitly taught*** as it's everything you should truly need in order to succeed with Git in this course.

In the afternoon Ramesh will introduce [***Investigations***](/investigations), which will be an outlet for students to research and share with the class further topics beyond the core curriculum that particularly interest them.

Finally then you'll start doing some data science.  Ling will guide you through an introduction to ***Pandas***, a lovely library for ***manipulating data in Python***.  This will be quite handy for the closing of the day, in which we'll introduce your first class project, [Project Benson](/projects/01-benson).  

Benson is a group project that will require you to manipulate a subway transportation dataset to glean insights that you will present at the end of the week.  These types of data manipulations are often given the rather ugly term "***Data Munging***", hence the name of the associated [Data Munging Challenge Problems](/challenges/01-data_munging) that will help guide you as you work on Benson.

After we've introduced Benson and assigned groups, you should have a couple hours at the end of the day today to either work on the Data Munging Challenges or your Project Benson Planning.  You're big boys and girls, so as always in here, your time delegation decisions are up to you!
