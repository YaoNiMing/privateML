# Welcome to Week 1: "Essentials"!

### <a name="overview"></a>Overview

We're beyond excited to welcome you all to the Metis Data Science Bootcamp!

You've arrived at the landing page for week 1, and for this and all future weeks you'll see an overview for the week to come that explains what we'll be learning that week and why.  Every day of the bootcamp will have a similar page for just the activities of that day.

Every weekly page will always include the following:
* [Week Overview](#overview)
* [Miscellaneous Notes for the week](#notes)
* [Metis Events (Speakers, socials, meetups, etc)](#events)
* [Important Due Dates and Deadlines](#dates)
* [Daily Topic Breakdown](#topics)
* [Aggregated Extra Resources List](#resources)

If you're allergic to my verbosity, you're always welcome to simply [skip to the bottom]() for the nuts and bolts!

As I'm sure you're by now aware, the bootcamp curriculum is ***project driven***.  That is, it is divided up into chunks based on 5 real-world style [projects](/projects) of varying lengths.  As we face each subsequent project together, the course content will correspond with skills that you need to tackle them.  For instance, when we learn Linear Regression you can be darn sure it will come in handy for the project that week.  As you learn new data science skills, technologies, and techniques there will always be a project that you're working on in the background to which you can apply your new talents!

The first project is [Project Benson](/projects/01-benson), which will be the shortest project clocking in at only 1 week.  As you're (perhaps) only just starting out as a young data science neophyte, the main focus of Project Benson and thus week 1 will be the following:  
* Working in a Data Science team
* Time Management
* The Project Lifecycle: aka how to actually deliver
* Presentation Skills
* Data Exploration

As you can see, there are a number of "soft skills" here.  These are important, as you could be one of the best technical data scientists around but if you can't (a) Work in a team, (b) Complete a deliverable, or (c) Communicate your results effectively, then you may not be very widely marketable to potential employers.  

#### Technical Focus
Still, just because there's a "soft skills" focus this week doesn't mean you won't get to get your hands dirty.  The technical lecture content during Project Benson will be focused on ***"The Essentials"***, skills (both basic and advanced) that you'll need to master to have success in the more advanced portions in the remainder of the course.  If you aren't already a ***Python*** guru, you'll see plenty of it this week and hereafter. For coding comfort we'll introduce you to some tips and tricks working with the [***Anaconda***]() [***scipy***]() Python distribution/environment and [***Jupyter Notebooks***]() for rapidly test driving code.  You'll also get some instruction, experience, and best practices with the ***Unix command line*** and Python itself.  Finally for the fun stuff, we'll introduce you to a variety of tools that you'll use to manage and manipulate data in Python throughout the course like [***Numpy***]() and [***Pandas***](), as well as how to visualize data with [***matplotlib***]() and [***seaborn***]().  All of the tools in week 1 need to be mastered, as they'll be absolute necessities for the remainder of the course.

#### Blogging
***If you want your ideas to be heard as a data scientist (or in anything), you have to communicate them.***  Blogging is a simple and easy way to share all your great work with the world.  For this reason, **we require students to publish blogs** as they complete projects or other aspects of the bootcamp.  If you don't already have a blog, you will soon as in week 1 we'll take some time to demonstrate setting up a simple one.  For more blogging musings and some examples, refer to the [Thoughts on Blogging]().

#### Git
Last but not least, week 1 will focus on a vital skill for anyone working with software code in the world today: [Version Control]().  Specifically, we'll teach you how to use [Git]() and [GitHub]() appropriately to maintain versioned copies of your own work as well as class materials.  We use GitHub both for distribution of materials as well as student work submissions, so you should make it your best friend ASAP!  (**Editor's Note:** Okay, maybe not your *best* friend...a dirty little secret about version control is that just about no one is a true *expert* with it and even those who are want to blow up the Git server with a DDoS attack from time to time.  For more on that and other things Git, see the [Note on Git](/references/git/note_on_git.md))
