# Welcome to Week 6: "Ensemble Methods and Unsupervised Learning"!

### <a name="overview"></a>Overview

You've basically finished your classifiers!  That means we're pretty much done with supervised learning.  On Monday we'll officially finish it and then move on to **Unsupervised Learning** with a brief break to see your lovely McNulty presentations on Wednesday.

Every weekly page will always include the following:
* [Week Overview](#overview)
* [Miscellaneous Notes for the week](#notes)
* [Metis Events (Speakers, socials, meetups, etc)](#events)
* [Important Due Dates and Deadlines](#dates)
* [Daily Topic Breakdown](#topics)
* [Aggregated Extra Resources List](#resources)

If you're allergic to my verbosity, you're always welcome to simply [skip to the bottom](#topics) for the nuts and bolts!

The third project is [Project McNulty](/projects/03-mcnulty), which will clock in at 2.5 weeks!  Project McNulty is another group project and its main focus will be the following:  
* Classification
* Interacting with Databases via SQL
* Data Visualization via D3

The fourth project is [Project Fletcher](/projects/04-fletcher), which will clock in at 2.5 weeks as well!  Project Fletcher is an individual project and its main focus will be the following:  
* Unsupervised Learning (clustering mainly)
* Natural Language Processing
* Working with APIs for data retrieval
* NoSQL databases for data persistence

#### Technical Focus
The technical lecture content during Project Fletcher will mostly consist of learning various **Unsupervised Learning Techniques**.  This week we will cover **Ensemble Methods** to wrap up Supervised Learning, the gambit of **Clustering** algorithms to introduce Unsupervised Learning, and finally some **Dimensionality Reduction** techniques for improved **Feature Extraction** (get your linear algebra hats ready!).  I also hope you really take **Ensemble Methods** to heart, as they're what a lot of the really good systems (Read: Netflix) are doing under the covers.  Additionally, for Fletcher you'll need to get your data from an **API** and store it in a **NoSQL** database, so we'll cover that this week as well!
