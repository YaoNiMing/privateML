### Plan for Tuesday, Oct 25

#### Overview
Good morning everyone.

Today we're going to move on to **Unsupervised Learning** as we talk about **Clustering**.  The lecture this morning will cover a variety of clustering algorithms in `sklearn`.  If we don't get through it all, we will come back to it, as I don't want your brains to feel to overloaded while you're finishing up McNulty.  For this reason, we'll also just do some slides.  You'll see some more clustering in `sklearn` on Friday, but it's pretty straightforward to implement (per usual).  From experience I think clustering is quite intuitive for people and you guys are wicked smaht, so I think you'll be fine.

**Remember:**
* Classification Challenges are due **10/28**
* Classification Errors Challenges are due **10/28**
* SQL Challenges are due **11/4**
