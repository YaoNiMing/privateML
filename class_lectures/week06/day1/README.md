### Plan for Monday, Oct 24

#### Overview
Did you miss me?  Probably not, but that's okay, I'll keep churning out these READMEs regardless.

So welcome to Week 6!  I can't believe how fast the time is going, almost halfway home!

Today we're wrapping up classification!  You've seen the main classification algorithms, and I bet you've been thinking to yourself "man, wouldn't it be awesome if we could just combine all of these into 1 super awesome unbeatable God algorithm?"  Well if so it turns out you're in luck (kind of)!  While I'll reiterate that **there is no one perfect algorithm** in here, **Ensemble Methods** can get you pretty darn close.  If you want to maximize the signal you're extracting from the features that you have, combining several models into one is probably the best bet.  And that's exactly what we'll talk about this morning.  In the process, hopefully you'll better understand how errors interact across different Machine Learning algorithms and somewhat demystify those spooky Random Forests and Boosted Trees.

In the afternoon, it's **FINISH MCNULTY TIME**.  Yes you don't present until Wednesday, but it'd be much better to spend Tuesday trying reach goals or finishing touches rather than having a mad dash to the finish.  We'll be coming around and checking in for sure, as today is really the last day to clear up any last minute panic attacks.

**Remember:**
* Classification Challenges are due **10/28**
* Classification Errors Challenges are due **10/28**
* SQL Challenges are due **11/4**
