#### Pair Problem

This morning your understanding of K Means will be put to test. You will write up your own function that would do KMeans clustering: `def KMeans(points,k)`

While this is straightforward, it does involve doing a few steps. So I set you guys up with a [Jupyter Notebook](pair-KMeans.ipynb) if you want a head start. You just need to complete two functions `assignPoints()` and `updateCentroids()` that are left blank in there.
