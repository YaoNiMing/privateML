### Plan for Thursday, Oct 27

#### Overview
Fantastic job on your McNulty projects, really happy with what you accomplished, and you should be too.

Now it's time to move on to [Project Fletcher](/projects/04-fletcher), which I'll introduce this afternoon.  Fletcher will require **Unsupervised Learning**, and specifically **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** which we'll get into next week.  

However Fletcher will also require you to get your data using an API, and store it in a NoSQL database, so those will be the topics today.

**Remember:**
* Project McNulty Blogs due **10/28**
* Classification Challenges are due **10/28**
* Classification Errors Challenges are due **10/28**
* SQL Challenges are due **11/4**
