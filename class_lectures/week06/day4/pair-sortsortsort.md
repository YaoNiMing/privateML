#### Sort, sort, sort!

**1) Write a function to sort a given list: def mySort(inputlist)**

Write your own sorting function to sort a given list. Don't use the python built-ins. Don't worry about efficiencies. *Just write a sort function that works.* What is the complexity of your function?

**2) I want to keep my list sorted and do find, insert and delete operations on it. One way to find elements we talked about is binary search. Write the find function using binary search. Then write insert and remove functions as well. It's okay if you don't get to complete all these functions. Just think about your approach and what the complexity would be.**

    def find(sortedlist,number): # this would return the index of the given number if it is in the list and -1 if not.
    def insert(sortedlist,number): # this would insert the number into the list at the right position.
    def remove(sortedlist,number): # this would remove the the given number if it is in the list.
