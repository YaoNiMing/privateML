### Plan for Friday, Oct 28

#### Overview
Fantastic job on your McNulty projects, really happy with what you accomplished, and you should be too.

Today is a fun day.  I'm excited, I hope you are too.  For those that felt abandoned in Pair Programming, never fear, you'll have tons of time with your partner on further exercises today.  They can't escape.

We'll cover **Principal Components Analysis (PCA)** and **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** for **Dimensionality Reduction**.  This will be invaluable for NLP next week, and your ML modeling in general as you can really extract some powerful features (although it might not be so clear what they mean!).

**Remember:**
* Project McNulty Blogs due **10/28**
* Classification Challenges are due **10/28**
* Classification Errors Challenges are due **10/28**
* SQL Challenges are due **11/4**
