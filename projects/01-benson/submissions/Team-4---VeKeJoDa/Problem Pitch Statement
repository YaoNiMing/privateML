Mr. Robert E. Foran  
Chief Financial Officer  
New York Metro Transit Authority  

We are a consulting firm that specializes in using data analysis for the public good. Upon review of the turnstile data at `http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html`, we found that there are distinct periods of the day where there are spikes in ridership. We believe by identifying these peak times, we can propose a dynamic fare reduction to incentivize ridership during off-peak hours to ultimately alleviate congestion and generate revenue.
