**The Challenge:**  
  
We are a team of data scientists working for the New York Democratic Party. The party wants to register as many new voters as possible in the weeks before the upcoming election. We have been tasked with optimizing the partyâ€™s effort to register new college/university students, whom we expect to vote disproportionately for Democratic candidates. We have identified the 15 largest colleges/universities in New York City that are within walking distance of a subway station, yielding approximately 40 target stations. We will analyze the turnstile data for these stations to determine optimal days and times to deploy our 10 voter registration teams in the immediate vicinity of each station.
