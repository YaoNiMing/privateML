## **Problem Statement**  
  
The MTA is looking forward to renewing 30 subway stations by 2020 in order to attract more riders and improve the experience of current riders. The current plan is to shut down entire stations for an average of 6-12 months per station to expedite renovations. However, shutting down stations for long periods of time works against the goals of the renovations, by alienating current riders and taking massive financial losses. Based on our preliminary analysis of turnstile data at these 30 stations, we believe we can develop a plan for keeping these stations open during renovations. We can identify off-peak hours in which to work by station, selecting optimal days of the week and hours of the day.
