## Project Summary
Alternative ride-sharing service provider Lyber enlisted us to provide analytics pertaining Uber services in order to gain a competitive edge in the New York City ride-sharing market. To do so, we used the MTA turnstile dataset in conjunction with Uber pick-up logs to exploit in inefficiencies in Uberâ€™s system for servicing riders who are using the ride-sharing service after exiting the subway station. In this project report, we provide the analytics and our recommendations of stations where potential inefficiencies can be exploited if Lyber targeted them with their drivers.
