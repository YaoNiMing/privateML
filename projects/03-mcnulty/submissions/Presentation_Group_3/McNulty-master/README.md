We wanted to build a emotion recognition system using different classification models. First we tested classification models on two datasets and then built a webcam app to classify the user's emotion and tweet it as an emoji. Finally we made a visualization to assess the performance of our models. In this repo is our presentation slides, the code for the twitter webcam app and the code for the neural network we used to classify images and the code for the D3 visualization.
