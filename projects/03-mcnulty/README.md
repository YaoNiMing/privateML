| **Design** | Group brainstorming |
| **Data** | Labeled UCI data; Relational Databases |
| **Modeling** | Classification/Supervised Learning |
| **Tools** | MySQL; cloud servers; scikit-learn |
| **Communication** | Data visualization; written reports |


### Synopsis:

In Project McNulty, students work "individually, together" as members of the internal data science team for fabricated companies. While the coursework focuses on supervised learning and relational databases, in Project McNulty the students apply these to their work, as well as continuing to develop their skills in brainstorming and data science project design, and in communication their deliverable is a document similar to an internal report, which uses prose and figures to accurately convey their results while still being mindful of audience breadth.

### Goals
* Exposure to classification methods, understanding of their use, and practice implementing them using scikit-learn
* Rigorous introduction to SQL and competence with general concepts of relational databases
* Additional familiarity with data science design process, particularly effective brainstorming and design in groups.

### How it works:

Bootcampers are split into groups such that each group is the "internal data science team" for a theoretical company. Students will work on individual projects, but the idea is that the groups topics will overlap (ex: Health Industry Group)  such that they can share data (SQL databases), etc.

They will use classification algorithms, SQL databases, and datasets (that they find) to create insights to help the company toward its goals.

### Timeline:

* ##### Week 4:
  * Groups are created
  * Groups "create" their company and brainstorm their project goals
  * Individuals work on their analyses
  * Individuals aim to finish the draft quantitative aspects of their analysis

* ##### Week 5:
  * Groups create a meeting agenda which gives an overview of the work they will present in the final report
  * Groups brainstorm on the type of data visualization results that can be shown given their findings
  * Groups implement data visualization (hopefully d3) by end of week

* ##### Week 6:
  * On Monday, teams meet to evaluate status and give peer feedback, final of final ideas discussed
  * Groups finalize their projects and web apps
  * The final version of the integrated team report is presented on Wednesday.


### McNulty Data
We used to give you data for McNulty, but you all are just too impressive for this.  So we're opening up the whole world of the web to you.  Go, be free, and find some sort of data that addresses a problem you're interested in!

**The Only Requirement**:  
Your data must fit into a classification problem.  That's it!  Beyond that, it's up to you.

Here are some sample datasets and we'll provide some more resources for open data on the web, but these examples might just be too simple for you overachievers :wink: :
