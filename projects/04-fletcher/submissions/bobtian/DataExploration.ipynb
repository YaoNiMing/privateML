      "[\"Hi,\\nHow are you doing? First off, I just hope you read the entire message. It had been a really tough week as I lost you, mike is leaving, and I have something really serious happening to me that I can't talk about at all in this message(or possibly ever).\\n\\nI want to say again that I am sorry for that in-the-moment decision on Monday. I knew it was a bad one as soon as I said what I said, and I was too proud to take it back. I guess I was angry because spent the last year or so under the impression that I could somehow impress you (by either showing that I'm a nice person, or showing how much I care about you, or set myself in a position to be successful or something, I don't know), and then I could make up for whatever it is that you think I lack as a guy, so that you'd possibly change your mind about me (I know I'm not the most attractive guy, but I know that's not important to you). And your text about how you won't ever change your mind, along with your liking of this Joey guy whom you literally just met, made me really bitter about everything. I felt like no matter how much I try to be a good guy, I can never ever be good enough for you. I'm still coming to terms with that. I always knew you were out of my league, but something in the back of my head is just in denial, and I wanted to give it a shot so badly...My frustration drove me to that point, and I really meant no ill will. It was total cowardice, but I needed to do something to make myself feel better at the moment, so I said what I said thinking I can make everything go away by calling it quits with you.\\n\\nHowever, this past few days made me realize that as much as it pains me to see you crushing on other guys who doesn't make nearly as much effort to impress you or care about you as I do, it's still nothing compared to the agony of cutting off ties with you...I don't know what to do, but I still care about you a lot, and that's never gonna change. \\n\\nEver since we decided to stop being friends, I've been in depression mode, didn't go to school, and was constantly checking to see if you had made any efforts to contact me through facebook/hotmail/whatever. So I guess from the moment we said those last words to each other, I knew it was not what I want, but I was too scared to admit it. I unfriended you on facebook to stop myself from snooping your wall every 5 minutes to see if you're whether you're okay or a mess like I am. \\n\\nIt's really tough for me because we've been best friends since Janelle and I broke up. You mean so much more to me than just someone I like. Way before I started to have a crush on you, you already meant the world to me, and I had a lot of fun with you (I hope you did as well with me). Our relationship had been deteriorating ever since I asked you out last year. But our friendship (i guess along with me being in denial of your total rejection, but MOSTLY it's the friendship!) kept me around. There were good days and there were bad days. But at the end of the night, as angry/frustrated as I am ever gonna get about us, I still care about you too much as a friend to leave you. I am really depressed and lost right now. I want to know how you are, I want to know what you think about this whole thing, and I most of all want to see you and talk to you in person.\\n\\nIf you think the damage is done, and it's too late, I will(quite reluctantly) leave you alone and wish you the best. But hopefully at least you will let me do that in person. What I did was really lame, and I hope you forgive me for that. If you think you can give me another chance, I will be very very grateful of that. I may never get over you, or understand what qualities I am lacking compared to the guys you'll eventually be with, but at least I won't lose a friend, which I learned this week to be much much worse.\\n\\nBob\"]\n",

reason to phase me out?\", \"i'm not saying now\", 'but you will', 'everyone gets annoying sometime, i need to grow up about it', 'bob, did you have fun on saturday?', 'i tried, that was not by choice', 'not exactly, but we had moments', 'i asked you to bring umar for a reason', 'i get annoyed at abdul too, and umar sometimes', \"its nobody's fault\", 'and i had to see you, it had been too long, im not blaming anybody', \"this happens with you, but if we dont talk about it, it'll probably end up being bad, so im glad we can talk about it\", \"i dont know...that's my 2 cents\", 'well yes of course', \"i don't think its a big deal either\", 'and neither of us are idiots', \"it's one of those things\", 'and how can i not think that', \"i'm not saying that you will now\", \"no i shouldnt, but i will tell you what's up from now on\", \"but i don't think you should have to work really hard at wanting tobe my friend\", \"you're the one who said we're not gonna be friends and im gonna phase you out\", 'so this is a big deal, and it doesnt ahve to be that way', \"listen i'm not upset\", 'i wish you had fun saturday because i was having a great time', 'but there was nothing i could do about it', \"i guess i get annoyed when you get absorbed into your own little world and when i'm visibly unhappy and i see you enjoying yourself and ignoring me, i just want to leave\", 'i was trying SO hard', 'i cant believe you thought i was ignoring you', 'i stopped when i felt like i was babysitting you', 'i tried from the start', 'but whatever, i dont care about that anymore', 'you were until i made it clear it was an issue', \"and decided i wasn't in charge of your happiness\", 'i had said \"let\\'s climb that hill and look for fossils\" at least 15 times, and met with you

me, like that\", \"and it's not even that im not having fun, i would've had so much fun, but i just couldnt stop thinking about being ignored, that everytrhing just turned sour\", \"okay well i'm sorry\", \"and then i stopped enjoying anything, because you're enjoying everything...it made no sense\", \"i don't get it\", \"because i just think how you're always like that, and why that is that way, and how i dont want to be happy with it anymore\", 'you were annoyed because i was happy to be there', 'i dont know, i just was bothered', 'sometimes i think you want me to be someone i want', 'like you created this image of me', 'and then everything you do is just annoying', \"that isn't true\", \"well wow can't pretend that doesn't hurt\", 'its alright', \"i'm sorry, there's something wrong with me\", \"i'm just too use to a certain type of people\", \"i'm being too brutally honest now, i feel terrible\", 'the bubble just burst', \"and those things are not loveable things anymore - they're annoying things\", \"because there's so much good about you that made me love you for who you are despite things that bothers me\", 'its fine bob', 'no its fine i can take it', 'no those things didnt change', \"im just noticing the other things more, and that's my own doing\", 'i just knew in advance that it would be like that', 'thats why i asked you to bring umar', \"i mean everybody has different qualities, i'm like that too\", \"that's irrelevant grace\", 'i didnt bring him, he couldnt have made it, and our problem does not involve him', 'and that kinda got bad when i was being ignored', \"but i was annoyed that i couldn't feel natural without feeling like i had to make sure you were okay\", \"i wasn't annoyed with you in particular\", \"honestly i was only annoyed that you weren't having fun\", 'i think i just missed hanging out with you, because it was a long time since i saw you', 'i got annoyed that you couldnt just naturally not zone me out', 'because i felt like i missed you and didnt feel reciprocated at all maybe', 'i might have ADD', 'it could not be my fault', 'i was overstimulated', 'i love those kinds of places', 'ya i get it', 'maybe, im not scolding you, im just explaining and trying to make sense of my emotions at that point', 'i hate windows 8', \"i'm returning that laptop\", 'this wouldnt have happened if i saw you that day for buying the laptop', 'i just know it', \"after a month, you're suppose to miss me and talk to me, not pretending i dont exist when i am talking into your ear\", 'that was my most unhappy thoughts', 'i miss people in different ways', 'and i express it differently', 'i want to spend time with people, not spend time catching up on what was missed over the month', 'it didnt feel like time being spent for me, i just felt invisible, and frustrated', 'i spent more time with you than natasha you know', 'but i understand your frustration', 'and i understood it at the time too', 'and i want you to understand that i was consciously trying really really hard', \"even if you didn't notice\", 'you shouldnt be trying so hard, if your instinct is to ignore me, then just do it, maybe it just wasnt meant to work', \"i dont know why it's just so hard for you\", 'natasha noticed', 'if that helps', 'but its not to ignore YOU', \"i think that's where you take it too hard\", 'i dont want you to have to tryyy to be attentive', 'it has nothing to do with YOU', \"i'm just like that in general\", 'think about it, do i treat Umar differently?', 'if he showed up would i have been more attentive to him?', 'but i want you to know it has nothing to do with you', \"i'm not sure this is helping my defense\", 'no, but whenever i see you ignore him, i instantly make fun of it with him', 'i pick up those cues because to me i just cant stand it', 'and im trying to not take it personally', \"sucks that you can't tell\", \"byt yea, i'm not telling you that you have to try to change that\", 'well obviously i already am trying', \"i guess that's all we can do\", 'on the flip side though, im also trying very hard to make this work, i hope you realize that', \"because normally people dont stay friends with a person who rejected them, even if they dont feel that way anymore about the person, they're still constantly subconsciously reminded that they're inadequate in that person's eyes (whether it's true or not)\", 'and that can manifest itself in really stupid things', \"that's my take on it\", \"i'm always gonna feel insecure with you, or subconsciously feel like i'm not wanted, i

needed to say it to you', 'ya i thought you needed some time to say it first though', 'and secondly that its turning out this way', 'except dont let me pussy out', 'firstly for not liking you back or giving it a shot', \"nah there's nothing to say\", 'but all i can say is sorry', 'i wish i could say something to make it better', 'what do you mean', 'i need to make this work, i think we have to', \"i can't force you to be friends with me if you're annoyed with me all the time\", \"i don't see the advantage in that\", 'on either end', \"yes you can, because you know we were friends before, and this is all because of something you cant do anything about and it's unfair\", \"life isn't fair\", \"yea well you know what's one thing that i use to be happy about when you rejected me early on?\", 'and that somehow made me feel a little better', \"that you told me you're gonna be selfish and still make me be your friend...i felt wanted even though i was rejected\", 'you know so badly i want to keep you as your friend forevere', 'cant you just be like that?', 'as my friend', 'i want to be like that', 'but you know what someone said to me once', \"you know that's what i want in the long run anyway\", 'but in short spurts, i make stupid decisions', '\"you should have just stopped talking to me a long time ago and saved me the grief\"', 'i want to be selfish and keep you as my friend i really do', 'the grief is for a short term', \"but on saturday you weren't having fun and i didn' tknow what to do and everything i was doing and saying was starting to feel unnatural\", 'and all you had to do on saturday was tell me \"ok i cant focus right now, let\\'s make plans to hang out again this other day and have coffee\"', \"i can't change how annoyed you are with me though\", 'or i don tknow, whatever makes me feel like you actually do  want to catch up? i dont know', 'well obviously the best place to get me to focus is at coffee!', 'its funny that you feel insecure', 'but i really loved that place bob', 'i want to go back', 'point is, again i just naturally feel insecure sometimes with you, because of the way we worked out', \"that's something i need to work on\", 'on that occasion', 'which could be true', \"i felt like you'd have more fun if i wasnt there\", \"i haven't stopped thinking about yoru science comment you know\", 'because I\"M the one who is insecure', 'only insecure about you', 'i would have had more fun if you were there and you were also having fun', \"honestly only on saturday because i was upset you weren't happy\", 'thats my brutal honesty', \"that's not that brutal\", 'but its not something i need', 'can i add something here', \"i just want to live in what i'm doing at the moment\", 'so i know you need it', \"and i had my moments where i felt like were' catching up on things\", 'for a while when it was just you and i, you were pretty focused', 'i\\'ve never liked the \"catch up\"', \"not talk about the last while we weren't together\", 'no, just talk about ANYTHING', 'i get why people like the catch up', 'because that was the only reason i was there, you know?', 'i had no interest in that place', \"yes i know but you didn't try to make conversation\", 'we just like different things', \"its lik ehow i loved the bean and you didn't\", 'i wanted to hug that place', 'that hurts because i loved that place', 'i was thwarted too much that i was afraid of being shut down', 'and secretly i want everyone to love it as much as i do', 'i hate when people talk through tours', 'yea, but at least we can have good conversation from time to time', \"i've always enjoyed hanging out with you when talking is involved\", 'i even tlaked to you throughout the tour', 'like when we were sitting on the grass', 'so if im not talking, what was i doing there', 'obviously its okay', 'well no its secretly not becuase i feel like you just stepped on my harry potter book or something', \"why don't you enjoy hanging out with me if no talking is involved though\", \"well i'm sorry i didnt care for the place?\", \"but i'll get over it\", 'but from you its the opposite', 'i want to have a conversation', 'you talk a lot, but you dont listen', 'and you know i get a lot of crap from people for talking too much', 'and not being able to enjoy silence together', 'i never understood that', \"why can't we sit and enjoy eachothers company in silence\", 'okay but you know it comes out forced when you tell me that', 'i wanted to sit on the grass andnot talk', 'but i knew you wanted a confo', 'if you enjoy us sitting in silence more, maybe we shouldnt hang out', 'so i tried hard to make one', \"i don't understand\", \"okay well i can't tell you what mood i'm going to be in\", 'ok then maybe i shouldnt have came at all', 'also you kow us talking was the complete annoyance of natasha... she would have chosen to sit in silence', 'because i dont enjoy it, and i dont want you to feel like im not enjoying the silence', \"that's not what i'm saying\", 'ok im just gonna say this', \"if you're in the mood to not talk, you might as well tell me, and i'll just play on my phone or something\", \"but i'll secretly be annoyed that you need your phone as entertainment\", \"if you dont tell me, im just gonna keep talking to you, and then you'll probably zone out, and im gonna feel angry\", 'what do you want me to do? sit and do nothing?', 'i just wanna make sure you know that', \"that's what i want you to want to do\", \"but not if its not what you don't want\", 'this is getting silly and nit picky now though', \"yea it's completely unreasonable to expect everyone to be comfortable with that\", 'my honest opinion', \"your'e mad at me\", \"no i'm not at all\", 'i feel like what happened just now though is we created a very rigid scenario in which we can hang out', 'and both be happy', \"well that's a start i guess\", \"i don't see that as being a start\", \"honestly, if you took me to hang out with, i don't know... sean at a physics conference\", \"yea well there's a bit of an asymmetry about our situation, how it turned out and all...and we're gonna have to deal with it\", 'you could take me to an astronomy talk', 'and i wold still be like \"okay well i\\'m here anyway and this has nothing to do with bob\\'s fault\"', 'it could be about athiesm', 'regardless of how much i hated the speech', 'but i would go beause you are my friend and i would be okay with it', \"obviously i wouldn'thave fun\", \"and i don't think i'd blame you for any of it\", 'alright then', \"i guess i'll try to be more accomodating ofthat\", 'but at some point, if this is going to be a real friendship', \"i mean if you dont think it's worth it\", 'you have to get rid of that assymtery', \"i'm trying my best, and at this point, i thought being honest is the best thing to do, so this conversation might not be so comfortable, but i made my decision to have it\", 'anyways i will be more accomodating and considerate of the hang out scenarios then', \"but i don't see how that helps either\", 'bahah assymetry... asymmetry', 'you have no idea how much some shit hurts and needs time', 'i wanted to apologize to you a few week sago', 'and i agree with you on that', \"it's unfair to you, and im working on it\", 'it snot unfair to me bob... its just karma... i was unfair to you', 'its like that', \"i guess we both have to deal with it, it seems dumb but it's a starting point like i said before, but i'm confident it'll get better\", 'i try to feed off your confidence then', 'how about you pick the next hang out', \"i'm trying to not make the mistake i made with janelle\", 'hence the communication....', \"well you'll be working downtown\", 'or up town ish', 'ya ive already started', 'i work 8:30-4:30', 'well anytime next week if you wanna have coffee in that area', 'or come down to my area', 'ya sounds good', \"we'll work something out\", \"but that discomfort i would've been okay with if none of this happened, and im sure it'll be okay eventually\", 'its a lot of pressure', \"i know it's stupid that i need you to not be silent\", 'well can you help with conversation please', 'because i always end up in stupid conversation to fill gaps', \"and say htings i don't want to talk about\", \"text me when you are in the mood to have coffee and chat, i'll respond if i am too...it's pretty standard :P\", 'honestly bob its not only that you want me to talk', 'its that you want me to talk about things you are interested in', \"and get upset if i don't\", 'like in chicago', \"and on saturday i knew there were things we talked about  you didn't want to talk about\", 'that was totally because it was 2 against 1', \"i hate 2 against 1, you guys like shutting me

are not deep rooted annoyances', \"there's stuff i have to work on\", 'i dont want you to be annoyed either', \"i'm not going to pretend this conversation left me all happy and excited and relieved\",

talked about', 'and i always wish the opposite', \"i don't mind talking\", \"i just don't always feel better after\", 'yea but a lot of times i feel a lot shittier than you before talking, and maybe im an asshole for wanting to feel better', 'at your expense', \"but i wouldnt have started being brutally honest if i didnt think it's better for us that i do\", 'ya thats fine', 'so we good?', \"i
