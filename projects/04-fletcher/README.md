### Synopsis:

Project Fletcher involves analyzing text data with one or more of Natural Language Processing techniques. It is a two week project, and students have the choice to make it the first step of their passion project (which will come to full fruition during Project Kojak).

### How it works:

Students choose a question to answer related to natural language processing, and gather text data to this end. API sources are preferred but not enforced. (The important distinction is that extensive time should not be given to data collection, as with scraping websites).

Techniques they learn and will apply include clustering algorithms, keyword extraction, topic models, approximate nearest neighbor algorithms and NoSQL databases.

The end deliverable will be either a blog post that communicates their findings or an interactive dashboard, depending on what fits the project best. Note that dashboards must be accompanied by sufficient supporting documentation. In sum, all projects must be written up and shared publicly.  

On the final day of week 8, each student will deliver a short (3-4 minute) "demo day" presentation, introducing and emphasizing three key presentation features:

1. Since there are no more fictional "backstories," students will practice briefly introducing themselves at the beginning of their presentation.
2. The presentation should be crystal clear about the motivation of the presentation and how the project seeks to address its motivating question.
3. Each presentation should include a simple "schematic" diagram that illustrates some system within the project: either how the problem space works (the relationships between hollywood studios, distributors, and theater operators), how the solution works (the flow of data from the source(s) through the model), etc.

Slides as such are not necessary, though the audience does need something interesting to look at during the presentation.

### Timeline:

 * ##### Week 7:
     * Design decisions, data collection and initial iterations
     * By Friday, students should do a progress check-in with the instructors

 * ##### Week 8:
     * Final analyses, visualization, blog posts
     * Students share the links to their writeups before Friday
     * On Friday, students present and share peer feedback on the presentations and write-ups, including the interface, results and communication clarity
