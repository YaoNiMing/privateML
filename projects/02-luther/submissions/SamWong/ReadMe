Goal: To predict Domestic Gross Revenue from Ratings. As shown in the presentation, I ended up adding dummy variables for MPAA Ratings and Movie Studios as well.

Data Sources: Box Office Mojo, OMDB API (IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes info there)

					OMDB_API.ipynb - grabbing data from OMDB API
					GettingInfoFromHTML.ipynb - creating a merged dataframe of all data
