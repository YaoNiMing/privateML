# Luther Prospectus - D.H. Kim

The business problem I want to solve is my perceived inadequacy of the movie industry on predicting money making movies. I want to learn whether or not there are correlations between gross revenue and regressors such as genre, MPAA rating, budget, size of production companies, nearness to holidays and others. My data comes from The Numbers, a movie analytics company that tracks the box office performance of Western movies. There are a total of 5000 movies in my data, and there are a total of 30 regressors. 
  
The reported adjustd R-squared value on the training set of a plain vanilla linear regression is 0.43. This is without any feature selection, regularization, mean normalization, PCA or any other techniques that may improve model performance. I intend to dutifully pursue a model that closely predicts how a movie may gross given certain measurable parameters.
