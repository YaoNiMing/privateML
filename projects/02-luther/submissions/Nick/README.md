Award winning actors: Are they worth the price?

Central Question: Can Domestic Total Adjusted Gross Earning of a film be predicted based on the number
of awards won by starring actors?

I scraped from Wikipedia and Box Office Mojo

There are 3 separate files in here:
	-Actors-MVP-Final contains my first analysis that added all of the awards and actor had won over their career
	and assigned that to them for every movie they appeared in
	
	-Actors-Awards_year_adjusted-FINAL contains the code where I adjusted the awards so that in a given movie
	an actor only is associated with awards that they had won up until that movie's release
	
	-Actors-Awards_year_adjusted_plus_budget contains the above code with the addition of a production budget analysis
