# Predicting Worldwide Movie Gross from Domestic Box Office and other Factors

In this project, I first scrape with the film_scrape2.py file then use the LutherProject file to clean the dataset, build models, and test them. I look at several factors including the percent change in box office gross between Weekend 1 and Weekend 2 and weekend 2 and weekend 3. I also look at the gross per theater for weekends 1 2 and 3 for each movie. Finally I include the critic and audience score from rotten tomatoes and the genre that each movie is. 

#To do:
- Build functions to handle all the model building
- Remove reduendant code
- Clean up syntax
- Add more comments
