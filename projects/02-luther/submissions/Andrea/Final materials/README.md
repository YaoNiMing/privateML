**Problem:**  
To Predict IMDB Rating of movie remakes from characteristics of the original and remake itself

**Data:**  
--Pairs of remakes and originals scraped from Wikipedia
--Various variables from OMDB API
--Some financial information from IMDB business pages for each movie (didn't get a chance to explore this)
--List of all movies for which Box Office Mojo has Data

**Jupyter Notebooks:**  
*Andrea_Luther1:* Scraping data on pairs of movies and remakes from Wikipedia  
*Andrea_Luther3:* Scraping data from Box Office Mojo to determine how many films it has data for  
*Andrea_Luther2:* Comparing list of target movies from Wikipedia with movies Box Office Mojo has data on, and realizing Mojo only has info for 30% of them  
*Andrea_Luther_omdb:* Using OMDB API and IMDB business pages to get data on my target movies from Wikipedia instead, and cleaning up this data to prepare for analysis  
*Andrea_Luther_analysis:* Running models on the final dataset
