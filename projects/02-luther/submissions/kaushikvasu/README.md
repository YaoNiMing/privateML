### Summary
Project Luther is a prediction model to predict how long a movie would be in release for.  

Used Box Office Mojo and IMDB data.  


Attached are the proposal, presentation, the final csv from which I analyzed, and 3 different jupyter notebooks.  

The first notebook is the webscraping.  
Second is cleaning and preliminary analysis.  
Third is the final analysis.
