# Luther Prospectus - Chris Buie

Box office Movies are very expensive to make. Being able to accurately predict the drivers of a movies success would help make investment decisions. My goal is to create a regression model that will predict gross profits utilizing data obtained via web scraping and hopefully expose some of these drivers . I will be using three regression models in this analysis, Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Gradient Boosted Regression.
