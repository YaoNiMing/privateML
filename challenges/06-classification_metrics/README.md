**Topic:  Classification Metrics**

**Settings:  Where applicable, use test_size=0.30, random_state=4444.  This will permit comparison of results across users.

**Data:** congressional votes [Congressional Voting Records Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Congressional+Voting+Records)

#### Exercise 6.1

For the house representatives data set, calculate the accuracy, precision, recall and f1 scores of each classifier you built (on the test set).

#### Exercise 6.2

For each, draw the Precision-Recall curve, ROC curve and calculate the AUC.

#### Exercise 6.3

Draw the Precision-Recall curve, ROC curve (and calculate AUC) for the logistic regression classifier from **Exercise 5.12** in 05-Classification Challenge that uses [Haberman Survival Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Haberman%27s+Survival)
